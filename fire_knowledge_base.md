## Recent Incidents & Lessons Learned

### Ohio Agricultural Fire - Summit County (2024)
- **Location**: Rural volunteer department
- **Incident**: Barn fire spread due to limited water supply
- **Lessons**: Importance of pre-planning agricultural risks, mutual aid coordination
- **Application**: Relevant for rural departments with agricultural properties

### Urban High-Rise Response - Cleveland (2023)
- **Challenge**: Evacuation of elderly residents
- **Solution**: Enhanced pre-incident planning with building management
- **Key Factor**: Social vulnerability considerations in high-rise buildings

## Data Sources & How to Access

### OFIRMS (Ohio Fire Information Reporting Management System)
- **URL**: https://ofirms.dps.ohio.gov
- **Data Available**: Incident reports, response times, fire causes
- **How to Use in CRA**: Trend analysis, identify high-risk areas
- **Note**: Data updated quarterly

### Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)
- **Source**: CDC/ATSDR
- **URL**: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/
- **Key Metrics**: 
  - Socioeconomic status
  - Household composition & disability
  - Minority status & language
  - Housing type & transportation
- **Application**: Identify vulnerable populations for targeted prevention

### Census Bureau Data
- **American Community Survey (ACS)**: Demographics, housing age
- **How to Access**: https://data.census.gov
- **Useful for**: Understanding community characteristics, housing stock age

## Risk Factor Interconnections

### Aging Population + Older Homes
- Older adults 65+ have 2.5x higher fire death rate
- Homes built before 1980 lack modern fire safety features
- Medication can impair response time
- **CRA Consideration**: Prioritize smoke alarm programs in these areas

### Social Vulnerability + Fire Risk
- Low income areas often have older housing stock
- Language barriers affect emergency communication
- Lack of transportation impacts evacuation capability
- **Strategy**: Culturally appropriate prevention programs

### Industrial Facilities + Residential Proximity
- Chemical facilities near residential areas increase evacuation risk
- Older populations have slower evacuation times
- **Data Needed**: LEPC Tier II reports, population density maps

## Emerging Trends (2024-2025)

### Lithium-Ion Battery Fires
- Increasing in e-bikes, power tools, EVs
- Different suppression tactics required
- **Risk Assessment Question**: "Do you have regulations on e-bike charging?"

### Wildland-Urban Interface
- Even in Ohio, interface fires are increasing
- Climate change affecting fire season length
- **Relevant for**: Communities with wooded areas, parks

### Post-COVID Building Use Changes
- More vacant commercial buildings
- Increased residential fires (people home more)
- **Consider**: Changes in occupancy patterns

## State-Specific Resources (Ohio)

### Ohio Department of Public Safety
- Fire Marshal's office resources
- Training requirements
- Grant opportunities

### Ohio Fire Chiefs' Association
- Best practice sharing
- Networking with similar departments
- Annual conference insights

## Questions to Ask Based on Community Type

### Rural Departments
1. Agricultural operations and seasonal risks?
2. Water supply challenges?
3. Mutual aid response times?
4. Volunteer recruitment and retention?

### Urban Departments
1. High-rise building inventory?
2. Population density and demographics?
3. Infrastructure age and condition?
4. Homeless population considerations?

### Suburban Departments
1. Mix of residential/commercial risks?
2. School and institutional occupancies?
3. Traffic patterns affecting response?
4. Growing or declining population?
